While walking, I decided to pause and observe the large rising moon. At the same time, a flock of 16 geese appeared due east of me, heading towards Lake Champlain like all of the other flocks. It was 7:34 PM. I immediately noticed that in the second-to-last position of this flock’s left arm of the V was a goose of diminutive size and a noticeably faster wing beat. The overall cadence of the bird’s wings seemed like that of a large duck. Over the next 10-15 seconds as it approached, I got a better sense that its overall size was a bit larger than a mallard and that both the body size and wingspan were smaller than the Canada Geese. Hard to say how much faster its wingbeats were compared to the Canadas, but I would estimate 30% faster. As the goose approached to fly directly over me, it had a noticeably shorter neck and smaller head than the Canadas. The flock’s distance from the ground at this point was about 100ft - even with the tallest white pine trees near the flock. Very similar plumage pattern to Canadas. That said, due to the extremely bright moonlight rising while there was still enough dusk light to effectively see, I saw more white moonlight reflect off of the Canada Geese breast than that of the Cackling Goose, suggesting that the Cackling had a darker breast than the Canada Geese. As it continued on, it fell back to the last position in the V. This was the last flock that I observed this evening. The flight trajectory of this flock at the time of flyover suggested that it was heading towards the area of Red Rocks beach in Shelburne Bay. Amazing chance.","Decided to go on a walk after dinner because I heard so many flyover Canada Geese. Started 7:13, ended 7:45. Last flyover was 7:34 which included the Cackling Goose. 71F, clear skies, evening dusk with large, bright rising moon."

At this time, a second merlin took off from a location near to where the first one originated and exhibited identical flight behavior before perching close to the other merlin.
