In this lab, I used this [model](https://github.com/Ian8VT/Ian8VT.github.io/blob/master/QGIS/Lab%201/model_final.png). For an outline of this model's workflow and functions, check out this previous [page](https://github.com/Ian8VT/Ian8VT.github.io/blob/master/QGIS/Lab%201/lab_page.md).

With this model, I made a distance plot and direction plot of Burlington, VT rent prices. The distance plot displays how median monthly rent prices change at differnet distances from the city center and the direction plot displays monthly rental prices in terms of the direction that the region is from the city center.

The following two maps represent the direction of Burlington's census tracts from the central business district and the distance of those tracts from that point, respectively.
