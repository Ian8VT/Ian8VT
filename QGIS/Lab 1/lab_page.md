# First QGIS Model
In this week's lab, I created a model to calculate distance and direction of a city's census tracts from a single point. I then used this model in the example of Chicago. Download the model [here](https://github.com/Ian8VT/Ian8VT.github.io/blob/master/QGIS/Lab%201%20and%202/distance_cardinaldirection.model3).

## Workflow of Model

![distance](https://github.com/Ian8VT/Ian8VT.github.io/blob/master/QGIS/Lab%201/Chicago_Distance.png)

With this model, I made a [distance plot](https://github.com/Ian8VT/Ian8VT.github.io/blob/master/QGIS/Lab%201%20and%202/scatterplot2.html) and [direction plot](https://github.com/Ian8VT/Ian8VT.github.io/blob/master/QGIS/Lab%201%20and%202/polarplot2.html) of Burlington, VT rent prices. The distance plot displays how median monthly rent prices change at differnet distances from the city center and the direction plot displays monthly rental prices in terms of the direction that the region is from the city center.
