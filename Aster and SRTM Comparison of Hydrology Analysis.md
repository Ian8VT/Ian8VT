For this hydrology analysis, I conducted one analysis with ASTER data as the initial elevation data and a second analysis with SRTM as the initial input. With each, I performed the analysis with Saga tools in the Windows Command Prompt. Each map displayed contains commentary written on the map to explain what is visualized.
