# Mapping Water Flow of Mount Kilimanjaro

In this lab, we used the software SAGA to derive a terrain map from a digital elevation model of the Mount Kilimanjaro region to determine water flow. For my data, I accessed the Aster Digital Elevation Model version 3 from the NASA site [EarthData](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/).
