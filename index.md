## Hello and Welcome to my GitHub Page

Currently, this GitHub page displays my completed work from my Middlebury College course of Open-Source Geographic Information Systems, taught by Professor Joseph Holler. On this page, you'll find my lab projects organized by the primary open-source software that I used to pursue each lab's research questions. Alongside the display and analysis of the data in most lab projects, there is an expanded discussion on the important GIS topics touched on through the course of the lab, such as the display of uncertainty and replicability of academic papers.

[QGIS and PostGIS](qgis/qgis.md) - This folder contains the six labs that I primarily used the software of QGIS and PostGIS to develop.

[SAGA](saga/saga_index.md) - This folder contains the two labs that I used the software SAGA to create.

[Quick responses to academic papers](responses.md) - Located here are short responses to academic papers in the field of GIS.
