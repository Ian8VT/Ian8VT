## Hello and Welcome to my GitHub Page

This GitHub page displays my completed work from my Middlebury College course of Open-Source Geographic Information Systems, taught by Professor Joseph Holler. On this page, you'll find my lab projects organized by the primary open-source software that I used to pursue each lab's research questions. In addition to the display and analysis of data presented in the labs, many of these labs contain a discussion on important GIS topics touched on through the course of the lab, such as the visual display of uncertainty and the replicability of academic papers. 

[QGIS and PostGIS](qgis/qgis.md) - This folder contains the six labs that I primarily used the software of QGIS and PostGIS to develop.

[SAGA](saga/saga_index.md) - This folder contains the two labs that I used the software SAGA to create.

[Quick responses to academic papers](responses.md) - Located here are short responses to academic papers in the field of GIS.
