## First QGIS Model
In this week's lab, I created a model to calculate distance and direction of a city's census tracts from a single point. 

[Download the model here!](Distance_Degrees_CBD.model3)

With this model, I made [this scatterplot graphic](scatterplot_script.txt) and [polarplot](polarplot_upload.txt) of Burlington, VT rent prices.
