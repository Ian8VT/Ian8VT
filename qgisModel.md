## First QGIS Model
In this week's lab, I created a [model](Distance_Degrees_CBD.model3) to calculate distance and direction of a city's census tracts from a single point. 

With this model, I made a [scatterplot](scatterplot_script.txt) and [polarplot](polarplot_upload.txt) of Burlington, VT rent prices. The scatterplot displays how median monthly rent prices change at differnet distances from the city center and the polarplot displays monthly rental prices in terms of the direction that the region is from the city center. Note that the display key on the polarplot would not update, but each dot on the graphic is the regional median rental price of that's region given degree of orientation from the city center. Distance is not a factor in the polarplot graphic.
