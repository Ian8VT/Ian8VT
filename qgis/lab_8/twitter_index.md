# Twitter Activity during Hurricane Dorian
## Which created more activity during the storm: The hurricane or Sharpiegate?

### Introduction

Hurricane Dorian was an intense Category 5 hurricane that caused significant damage and loss of life throughout much of its course. When the storm directly hit the Bahamas, its winds were so strong that the storm became tied for the highest recorded hurricane winds in the Atlantic Ocean to ever make landfall. After the grave destruction the storm caused on the Bahamian Abaco Islands, Dorian slowly weakened though remained a powerful hurricane as it closely followed the US coast northward. As a result of the storm's extreme destruction in the Bahamas and how closely it hugged the entirety of the US east coast, this storm generated a significant amount of attention, particularly along the east coast locations predicted to be nearest to the storm. However, the media attention for this storm was even greater than that generated from the physical risks of Dorian because of the controversy that surrounded Sharpiegate, which you can read about on [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Dorian%E2%80%93Alabama_controversy). 

The scope of this lab is to determine how much of an effect Sharpiegate had on the Twitter activity related to Hurricane Dorian. Specifically, I will examine if the most significant pockets of storm tweets corresponded with the accepted storm prediction or if the storm clusters followed the storm prediction of Sharpiegate. Essentially, this lab will examine which scenario had a greater effect on the spatial distrubtion of storm tweets: the real storm prediction or an exubarently defended mistake. Through this, the lab addresses the concept of whether reality or gossip more strongly effects people's actions.
