# Twitter Activity during Hurricane Dorian
## Which created more activity during the storm: The hurricane or Sharpiegate?

### Introduction

Hurricane Dorian was an intense Category 5 hurricane that caused significant damage and loss of life throughout much of its course. When the storm directly hit the Bahamas, its winds were so strong that the storm became tied for the highest recorded hurricane winds in the Atlantic Ocean to ever make landfall. After the grave destruction the storm caused on the Bahamian Abaco Islands, Dorian slowly weakened though remained a powerful hurricane as it closely followed the US coast northward. As a result of the storm's extreme destruction in the Bahamas and how closely it hugged the entirety of the US east coast, this storm generated a significant amount of attention, particularly along the east coast locations predicted to be nearest to the storm. However, the media attention for this storm was even greater than that generated from the physical risks of Dorian because of the controversy related to Sharpiegate, which you can read about on the Wikipedia page of the [Hurricane Dorian - Alabama Controvery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Dorian%E2%80%93Alabama_controversy).
