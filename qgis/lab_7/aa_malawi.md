### Introduction

In 2014, Malcomb et al. published an extensive paper which outlined their methodology and research into the devleopment of a multi-faceted climatic vulnerability assessment for Malawi. The authors positioned this household resilience assessment as an accurate and reliable tool to measure vulnerability due to the multiple types of data sources used for the model. Further, the authors suggested that this vulnerability assessment can be replicated for a number of different countries and that the results obtained from this assessment is a valuable contribution to the information utilized by experts and policy-makers. Since the authors position their model assessment as such a pivotal tool for climate change adaptation, it is reasonable to ensure that their work is reproducable and that the results obtained from their workflow agree with their asserted claims. As such, in this lab I will follow the methodology of Malcomb et al. and attempt to reproduce their final outputs for Malawi.
