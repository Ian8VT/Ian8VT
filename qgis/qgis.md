### QGIS and PostGIS Labs

The following project links are labs that I performed with a combination of QGIS and PostGIS softwares. The extent that each software is used is outlined within each lab.

#### [Lab One](lab_1/aa_chicago_lab.md)
The development of a model to measure distance and direction of census tracts from a single location with Chicago, Illinois as the example.

#### [Lab Two](lab_2/aa_burlington_lab.md)
Examining if rent prices in Burlington, Vermont and surrounding towns follow a spatial pattern based around the city's center business district (CBD).

#### [Lab Three](lab_6/aa_dar_lab.md)
In this lab, I used OpenStreetMap (OSM) data of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, to measure the urban resiliency of the most flood prone regions of the city. To do so, I developed an annotated and replicable SQL analysis workflow to take the original OSM input data sets outlined in the lab and create the analyzed output data, which I then used to create an interactive map hosted by Leaflet.

#### [Lab Four](lab_7/aa_malawi.md)
A question of replicability. For this lab, I attempted to replicate the Malcomb et al. study on Malawi's environmental resilience. As a group, my class colleagues and I collaboratively brainstormed to develop a probable SQL analysis flow to replicate the paper's results. Through the process of this lab, I encountered two different issues related to the unclear methodology of Malcomb et al. and use of inaccessible data sources which only enabled me to create a partial replication.

#### [Lab Five](lab_8/aa_twitter_index.md)
Comparing the spatial effect of Hurricane Dorian's projected path and Sharpiegate controversy within Twitter activity.

#### [Lab Six](lab_final/lab.md)
How long does it take to walk to school? A network analysis topology of Dar es Salaam, TZ, and a measurement of intersection frequency.
