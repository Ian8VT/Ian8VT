## Wetland Drains in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania with OpenStreetMap

### Project Outline
Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, is a highly mapped city on OpenStreetMap. This provides a unique opportunity to conduct a number of different geospatial analyses related to the city. [Ramani Huria](http://ramanihuria.org/), a community-based mapping project in the city that accesses this vast array of geospatial data, draws attention to the presence of damaging seasonal floods in the city which are often compounded by a lack of necessary infrastructure and city planning. Further, there are a large number of structures and settlements in the city that are built on terrain designated as wetland and are expected to be highly flood prone. When these two scenarios overlap, the residents of wetland settlements are highly susceptible to damaging floods. In this lab, I measured the total length of drains in these wetlands per square meter of building in the wetlands. I bounded my analysis by the subward boundaries in the city, the most local political boundary in the city, so that my final product is a number for each subward which represents how much length of drain per square meter of building is present in that subward's wetland terrain.
